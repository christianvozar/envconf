# envconf

```Go
import "github.com/christianvozar/envconf"
```

Package envconf provides a library that makes consuming environment variables easy given a particular specification.

envconf is inspired heavily by the work of Kelsey Hightower's [envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig). This package takes Kelsey's work and improves by adding the ability to use comma-seperated lists for environment variables and adds help output functions.
