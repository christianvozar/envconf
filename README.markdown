# envconf

```Go

```

Package envconf provides a library that makes consuming environment variables easy given a particular specification.

envconf is originally a fork of Kelsey Hightower's [envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig). This package takes Kelsey's work and adds the ability to use comma-seperated lists (slices) for environment variables and adds help output functions.
